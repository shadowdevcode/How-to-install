3. After the app is added, it will automatically open the chrome apps in your system. You can open the apps by typing chrome://apps/ in chrome search bar. From here you can launch the app by double clicking on its icon. You can also click on the button that says Launch this app to start postman.

4. Once the app is launched, you can right click on its icon, and then choose Options -> Keep in Dock for easy access in future.

5. You can start using Postman directly but it is better to Sign up and then start using Postman so that your previous work is saved. You can choose any email id but prefer using the one which is your primary email id, the one you use on github,etc.
