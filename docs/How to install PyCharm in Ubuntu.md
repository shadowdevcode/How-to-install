# How to install PyCharm in Ubuntu
Pycharm comes in two editions, Professional and Community. One can either download the community edition which is absolutely free or can get a student license which provides a free trial of the professional edition for an year. We will be learning how to install the community edition.

## Installing Community edition
1. Use this [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux) to download the community edition for linux.

3. Go to the location where downloads are stored. This can be the Downloads directory for example. Unzip the folder. You can do this manually or use the terminal. Use the command `cd` to go to the desired folder and the `tar xvf pycharm-community-2017.1.2.tar.gz` to uncompress.
